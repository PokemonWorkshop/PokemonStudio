# Pokémon Studio development team workflow

## Visual Management as an Organizational Principle

From the beginning of development, we have always chosen to organize ourselves using the principles of **visual management**.

In simple terms, it's a way **to make information concrete, readable, understandable, and memorable for all team members**. Everyone has access to the same level of information, and decision-making in the team is facilitated.

In the context of a volunteer project, where each contributor is free to organize themselves, it's an excellent way to facilitate access to information and reduce the number of unnecessary meetings.

Here's a list of elements that help facilitate this visual management:

- A task list using **GitHub Project** called [Backlog](https://github.com/users/PokemonWorkshop/projects/1) which gathers all the elements useful for software development. Needs, priorities, technical details. The goal is to understand at a glance what needs to be done and why. The "how" depends only on the development team.
- Clear, detailed, and simple processes.

### About the GitHub Project organization

The task list is organized using less principle for more efficiency:

- A [Backlog](https://github.com/users/PokemonWorkshop/projects/1/views/1) view to make sure everything is listed in one place
- A [Sprints](https://github.com/users/PokemonWorkshop/projects/1/views/2) view to display every sprint backlogs
- A [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/PokemonWorkshop/projects/1/views/5) view to display all sprints
- A [Roadmap](https://github.com/users/PokemonWorkshop/projects/1/views/4) view to display all versions to come and their tasks

## Project organization

We follow a project methodology called _Scrumban_, adapted to the project's context. It blends the principles of [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/learning-series/what-is-scrum) and [Kanban](https://www.ionos.fr/digitalguide/sites-internet/developpement-web/kanban/) frameworks:

- Development is paced by periods of one month, called [Sprints](https://github.com/users/PokemonWorkshop/projects/1/views/2) or Iterations.
- Each iteration is introduced by a sprint goal, to lead the team to fulfill it and focus as best as possible.
- We reduce superfluous work and streamline as much as possible with a number of tasks chosen by each contributor based on their availability.

## About Figma organization

We're using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as a software to create our Design System and our User Interfaces (UI).

As a **collaborative software**, it is a powerful tool to work as a team and make sure everything is clear enough before starting development.

> [!NOTE]
> The Pokémon Studio Figma is in view only access. Only UI Designers are authorized to edit them. Please make sure to contact Walven or Aerun if you're interested in collaborating on UI Design purposes.

## Discord organization

We're using Discord to communicate and make our vocal meetings:

- **One meeting per month** which group Sprint review and Sprint planning events.
- Only team contributors can participate in those meetings for now _but we're thinking about making those public_.
- If you want to join the team, please make sure to contact Aerun on Discord.
